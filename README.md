# flashbang

A Rust crate for the STUN/TURN protocol.

## ðŸš§ WARNING: Currently under development ðŸš§

Flashbang aims to provide client and server implementations, as well as exposing the underlying interfaces for processing messages.
It also hopes to be runtime-agnostic, allowing for it to be compatible with any other async crate.

Currently, it offers partial support for [RFC 8489](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8489).
